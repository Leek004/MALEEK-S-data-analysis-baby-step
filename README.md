# MALEEK'S-data-analysis-baby-step
first project in the data analysis 30 days of learning hosted by the Oyinbooke 

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
1. Understand and practice the data analysis project steps as explained in the course
2. Practice using the analyze button in excel as demonstrated by the course instructor
3. Practicing the 14 excel pivot table tips and tricks explained by kevin stratvert in a tutorial linked in the course 
4. Practice proper github project documentation by creating a well detailed readme file for this project


* Side note:  For this project, two different datasets will be worked on. First one will be used to practice the usage of the analyse button and was provided directly by the course instructor.
The second dataset was downloaded from a linked youtube tutorial and will be used to practice  pivot table tips.   

### DATASET 1, STEP BY STEP BREAKDOWN OF TASK OBJECTIVES
1. Assess the given dataset to gain knowledge about it 
2. Ask at least five questions that will be answered by your analysis
3. Answer all five questions using the analyze button
4. Provide recommendations and insights from the answers

###  DATASET 1, DATA SOURCING
  The dataset used in this task was downloaded from the instructor’s github profile, as instructed. It contains financial data about a range of products across multiple countries and segments within a 2 year timeframe (2013 & 2014).


### DATASET 1,  DATA TRANSFORMATION
Since this task is about getting insights using the  analyze button in excel, no form of data transformation or cleaning was performed on the dataset.

* executing task objectives 1-4


### DATASET 1,  FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DATASET
* Questions answered about the dataset using the analyze button:
1. What year was the highest *number of units sold*? –  year 2014 accounts for the majority of units sold with a total of 861132 units sold which is approximately 3.2 times the number of unit sold in 2013 which was 264674 units

2. What year had the highest *gross sale*? –  2014 had the highest gross sale with a total of  $99,370,811.50 which is 3.4 times 2013’s gross which is $28,560,787.00 

3. How has the average product price changed across the years? – The average sales price per product has stayed the same at $118.43 for both years

4. How has the countries sold to and segment changed over the years? – The number and list of countries sold to, and segments has remained the same for both years 

5. How has the percentage of each product sold changed by year?-- Both years has seen the same pattern of sales across all product category

6. How has the distribution of discount bands changed over the years? – The proportion of each discount band has remained the same for both year 

7. How has the average manufacturing price changed over the years? – the average manufacturing price per product has remained almost the same for both years with 2013 at $96.65 and 2014 at $96.42

##### Insights derived from the answers.

* The sales for both years followed a very identical pattern in terms of average product price,percentage of product category sold, segment, country, discount band, manufacturing price, etc..

* Year 2014 had the highest number of units sold and gross profit. This is because only a quarter’s worth of sales data (september to december) for the year 2013 was provided in the dataset.

### DATASET 2, STEP BY STEP BREAKDOWN OF TASK OBJECTIVES
Practice along with the tutor on all 14 tips
Share concepts learned at the end of the tutorial  


###  DATASET 2, DATA SOURCING
The dataset used in this task was downloaded from the youtube tutorial linked in the course content, as instructed. It contains financial data about a range of products across multiple countries and segments within a 2 year timeframe (2013 & 2014).


### DATASET 2,  DATA TRANSFORMATION
Since this task is about using pivot tables in excel, no form of data transformation or cleaning was performed on the dataset.


### DATASET 2 INSIGHTS
*At the end of the tutorial, all tips shared had been practiced and recorded in the excel file shared in this repository, the following new tips were learned:
1. Using natural language in the analyze pane to answer specific questions automatically
2. Drilling down values in a pivot table
3. Creating pivot tables using multiple tables connected by defining relationship between the two tables
4. Changing field layout and sorting options to help you view all fields together or find certain fields easily
5. Adding calculated fields in a pivot table 
6. Sorting values within a pivot table to help view the data in a more hierarchical order
7. Showing values within a pivot table differently using the ‘show values as’ button
8. Using ‘summarize values’ within a pivot table to control how summarized values are calculated
9. Using slicers to quickly  and easily filter data in a pivot table
10. Using timeline within a pivot table to easily and quickly filter data based on date
11. Using a pivot chart to visualize data in a pivot table
12. Customizing pivot table layouts 
13. Grouping rows in a pivot table
14. Customizing row labels

# PROJECT CONCLUSION
 This project was completed as part of the lesson-1's assignment in the '30 days of learning' hosted by The Oyinbooke. After completing both tasks i've became more familiar with generating insights from a dataset using the analyze button, and also learned some cool pivot table tips.
